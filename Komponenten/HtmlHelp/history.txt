This file contains an overview about the library and viewer history.

//******************************************************************************************************
Version 0.4 (06 August 2004)
//******************************************************************************************************
- Fixed an issue with reading hhc/hhk files containing brackets ().

- Fixed an issue with identifying the master hhc in chm's containing multiple hhc files.
  In some circumstances this requires a storage enumeration which is slow on chm's with alot of content files.

- Fixed an issue with reading see-also items from text-based hhk-index files

- Fixed an issue with "See Also" index links. The shipped index user control now handles these special
  index items (IndexEventArgs now holds additional see also information)

- Fixed an issue with decoding urlstr file.

- Fixed an issue with parsing text-based index files. 
  Items now have the correct indent and deeper levels are supported !
  
- Changed accessibility of some internal CHM-decoding classes. 
  This will allow users of the lib to access more nativ CHM information/data structures.
  
- Added the properties ContentFile and FileContents to the classes TOCItem, IndexTopic and TopicEntry.
  The ContentFile property opens the associated content file and returns an FileObject instance if succeeded.
  You can use this instance to programmatically access the nativ file contents !
  The FileContents property directly reads the contents of the associated file and returns them in a string.
  This property automatically applies the correct CHM encoding to support multiple languages !

//******************************************************************************************************
Version 0.3 (02 June 2004)
//******************************************************************************************************
- Fixed the number of hits displaying in the search pane.
  If working with merged files, the maximum hits were applied per file not for the whole system.
  
- Fixed an issue during data decoding of binary table of contents.
  The system reads binary TOCs now much faster and doesn't have problems with building the tree in deeper
  TOC levels.

- Optimized index merging. 
  Index merging is no longer member of complexity class n². It's now log(n) (using binary search and
  insertion algorythm)
  
- Optimized memory usage. 
  Especially the memmory usage of table of contents and index items. The title and locale strings
  are no longer stored as strings in every item (only in CHMs with binary toc and/or index). 
  The item just holds offsets into the loaded system file data. After opening/merging a file to 
  the system and updating the UI you should call GC.Collect() to force a garbage collection 
  (this will free a view MB depending on the amount of CHM data).
    
- Added imagelist of standard CHM-Viewer
  You can now specify which imagelist you want to use by setting the flag HtmlHelpSystem.UseHH2TreePics.
  The default value is false (HtmlHelp 1.1 tree images will be used).
  NOTE: Always set this before opening any CHM files and before instantiating the 
  HtmlHelp.UIComponents.TocTree user control ! Changing it after those steps may result in IndexOutOfBounds
  exceptions (HH2 imagelist has more images than the HH1.1 one) !
  
- Added the method ClearContents() to the three internal user controls (toc-tree, index and search)
  which allows the user to reset the control's contents if opening new files.
  
- Added support for compressed dumping of data (speeds up CHM reloading). 
  During the file loading process, you can specify if the library should create a data dump, 
  by passing a DumpingInfo instance to the OpenFile() or MergeFile()  methods. 
  If the system can't find the dump, it reads the data from the CHM file and creates the 
  dump file. If the system finds the dump, it loads the data from the dump-file.
  As you know, the bottleneck of the data extraction are large sitemapfiles 
  (Regular expression parsing is slow). Enabling the dumping feature, will create a straight 
  forward dump of these data structures which makes a reload of the CHM file about 50-95% faster 
  (depending on the toc size and mode (binary or sitemap), compression level and your PC ;) ). 
  
- Added support for CHM-Merged file list (see #IDXHDR file)
  Note: The CHM with the master TOC MUST be opened first ! The MS standard CHM-viewer can also 
  create the TOC correctly if you open one of the slave CHMs. 
  This is not supported by the library (TOC tree will contain all topics, but not in a correct tree) !

- Added support for merged TOC-Items in hhc files ("Merge" parameter)

- Added support for information types and categories
  Information types and categories are only supported for a text-based TOC or Index (by HtmlHelp Workshop).
  You can define information types in HtmlHelp Workshop and assign them to table of contents nodes and 
  index entries. This allows a viewer to filter the contents which are displayed to the user.
  e.g. you can define the information types "SDK Reference", "FAQ", "HOWTOs" etc. and the viewer can
  filter help contents depending on the user's selection.
  You can define categories and assign one or more information types to this category. 
  e.g. define the categories "Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced", assign the previously created 
  information types to the categories and the viewer can filter help contents depending on the user's skill 
  level.
  
- Added an extended HelpProvider component for interacting with the HtmlHelpSystem

- Added native HelpToolTipWindow for adding Popup-Help support for applications using HelpProviderEx class.

//******************************************************************************************************
Version 0.2 (25th April 2004)
//******************************************************************************************************
- Fixed an issue which prevents the classlibrary from loading the correct
  table of contents file (text based hhc file).
  This happens in CHMs where the Contents file option of the HHP-File (htmlhelp project) 
  is not set and the HHC-File name is not the default one 
  (<chmfile>.hhc or table of contents.hhc). Same for text-based 
  index files. (found in MSDN-Magazin CHMs)
  
- Added international support.
  The library detetcs the LCID (language code id) and the used codepage and 
  adjusts the encoding used for converting binary arrays to strings.
  
- Fixed the fulltext-search algorythm.
  Still not 100% working for international languages (didn't find the error till now)
  
- Added a classlibrary CHM to the source zip.

- Added a ChmFileInfo class for easily getting system information of 
  CHM-Files (see loaded files in about dialog of the example viewer)
  
- Fixed an URL issue which prevents the IE (newest IE patch) to display linked content files correctly
