Gamodo.Studio
=============

From 2008 to 2009 I've wrote a little "web ide" with c# in my spare time. It was developed mainly for educational purpose. I've found this old project lying around on my hard drive and thought I could help some young programmers to write their own ide :). It is now released under MIT license. I have to apologize if the code is a little bit messy and I didn't had time to rewrite all comments in English so you maybe find German comments. Though it runs on new systems like windows 7, windows 8 it was developed on windows xp. So some things might be broken.

To be absolutely clear, this project was developed in 2009 and is not going to be continued. It is only released for educational purpose.

You need Visual Studio 2008.

##Gamodo Studio##

I used some third party components but there are heavily customized so updating to a new version is gonna be a problem. Here are some features which are stable:

##Code Parser##

My code parser works for html, css, js and php though in this release only html and css works fine.

##Quickletâ„¢ Engine (Snippets)##

I've developed a high customizable snippet engine I call Quicklets. Nowadays every good IDE has this feature. But back in 2008 only visual studio and gamodo studio had this powerful snippet engine. Even some popular Editors today don't have a good snippet engine like this. Just look at Sublime's implementation, no offense.  Quicklets are defined in a xml file. To trigger a Quicklet you have to type the keyword and hit Tab. You can Tab between defined variables or code segments.

Sample Quicklet xml

	<Template shortcut="class" text="class $classname$ extends $anotherclass$ {\n\n\tfunction $funcname$($argument$) {\n\t\t$end$\n\t}\n}" variables="4" docLang="0">
	    <Variable name="$classname$" value="ClassName" />
	    <Variable name="$anotherclass$" value="AnotherClass" />
	    <Variable name="$funcname$" value="__construct" />
	    <Variable name="$argument$" value="$argument" />
	</Template>

##Editor Control##

I'dont remember all highlights of this one, but you can look at the source.

##Code completion##

HTML is fully supported (other languages can be added easily) even with events, attributes and help text in german and english.

##Help Browser##

I've wrote a little Help Browser. It can load from different sources.
